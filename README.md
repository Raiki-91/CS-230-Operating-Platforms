# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to develop a cross-platform web-based game inspired by their Android app, "Draw It or Lose It," which emulates the 1980s TV game Win, Lose or Draw. The key software requirements included supporting multiple teams and players, ensuring unique naming for games and teams, and maintaining a single game instance in memory.

What was done well in developing this documentation:

The documentation effectively outlined the client's needs, technical constraints, and the proposed solution. It provided a clear understanding of the software requirements, design constraints, system architecture, and other critical aspects of the project.

The helpful aspects of working through a design document:

The design document served as a roadmap for the project, providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the software's architecture and functionality. It helped ensure that all essential aspects were considered and planned for before starting the actual development, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and scope creep.

One part to revise and how to improve it:

Although out of the scope of this assignment, a potential area for improvement could be in the evaluation section, providing a more detailed cost analysis and comparing the advantages and weaknesses of different platforms more quantitatively. This would offer the client a clearer picture of the financial implications and platform suitability.

Interpreting user needs and the importance of considering them:

Interpreting user needs is crucial because it ensures that the software addresses the client's requirements and the end-users' expectations. It helps deliver a product that functions as intended and provides a positive user experience, which is essential for user satisfaction and success in the market.

In our school assignment, the approach to designing the software involved considering the specified requirements, design constraints, and potential technologies thoroughly. For future projects of a similar nature, these strategies and techniques can be beneficial:

Continuous Communication: Maintain consistent communication with the project instructor or team members to ensure that evolving project requirements and feedback are seamlessly integrated into the design process.

Prototyping: Develop prototypes or mockups to provide a visual representation of the application's user interface. This allows instructors or team members to better grasp the design's look and functionality early on, facilitating more efficient design adjustments.

Agile Methodology: Utilize an agile development approach when appropriate. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, can be valuable for accommodating changing requirements and enabling incremental improvements, a key aspect of school projects.

User Testing: Conduct user testing within the school environment at different stages of development. This approach helps validate design decisions and ensures that the software aligns with the specified requirements and user expectations.

Security Awareness: Given the growing emphasis on security in software development, prioritize security considerations from the project's inception. Ensure that security concepts are integrated into the design to produce a more secure application, even within the context of a school assignment.

Scalability and Performance: In situations where scalability and performance are relevant, design with these factors in mind. This proactive approach allows the software to handle potential increases in user activity, which can be important for larger-scale school projects.

By applying these strategies in school assignments, you can create software that not only meets the project's requirements but also provides a more organized and educational experience for students and instructors.
